# Manual Testing Exercise2

## Project Overview  
This repository is dedicated to manual testing of a simple "Offer Creation Form" interface. The form includes features such as dropdowns, numeric input fields, date pickers, and validation requirements. The goal is to validate all functional and non-functional aspects of this interface.


## Key Features of the Interface  
1. **Offer Name**:  
   - Allows 4–6 character inputs only.  
2. **Product 1 & Product 2 (Dropdowns)**:  
   - Selectable options (e.g., A, B, C).  
3. **Numbers Input**:  
   - Accepts numeric values for calculations like "Number of Redundant" and "Gain/Outcome."  
4. **Date Pickers**:  
   - Includes start and end date fields with calendar selection.  
5. **Create Button**:  
   - Finalizes the offer creation process.



## Test Cases  
The test cases focus on the following aspects:  
- **Validation**: Ensuring correct input for all fields (e.g., name length, numeric inputs).  
- **UI Elements**: Verifying dropdowns, buttons, and fields work as expected.  
- **Functional Testing**: Checking form logic, calculations, and edge cases.  
- **Boundary Testing**: Testing inputs at their min/max limits.

# Manual Testing Exercise3

## Project Overview  
This repository is dedicated to documenting and validating a user input form through manual testing. The form captures data such as names, emails, phone numbers, file uploads, and testing experience, ensuring all fields adhere to mandatory and validation requirements.



## Objectives  
1. **Ensure all mandatory fields** in the form are correctly validated.  
2. **Verify the functionality of file upload features** for CVs and photos.  
3. **Validate input formats** for email addresses and phone numbers to meet specified standards.  
4. **Identify and document any potential bugs** or inconsistencies in the form's behavior.  
5. **Enhance the user experience** by ensuring clear error messages and form feedback.  
6. **Provide a comprehensive set of manual test cases** for quality assurance teams.



## Key Features of the Interface  
1. **Fourth Name**: A mandatory text field for the user's fourth name.  
2. **Company Email**: A mandatory email field for entering a valid company email address.  
3. **Foreign Phone Number**: A mandatory field for entering a valid foreign phone number.  
4. **Upload CV**: A file upload field for attaching a CV document.  
5. **Upload Photo**: A file upload field for attaching a personal photo.  
6. **Experience in Testing**: A mandatory field for specifying experience in testing.  
7. **Submit Button**: A button to submit the form after all fields are properly filled.
